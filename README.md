# StockBrokers
Create a program that looks up public companies or stock symbols based on certain search criteria. I parse a file containing a set of companyâ€™s information and their respective stock symbols. After ensure accurate parsing, I provide a command line interface to allow a user to query+manipulate the parsed data.
